\u25ba</span><span class=\"item-desc\"> You create and cast a magical effect defined by your creativity and mastery of the \u231eThreads\u231d. You cannot make this move if you have 0 Will.<br/><p>Describe what you want your weaving to do in defiance of reality\u2019s edicts. This can be practically anything you can think of, but there are some rules:<br/>    \u2022 weave magic on a personal, local, immediate scale.<br/>    \u2022 target one \u201cthing\u201d at a time\u2014that might be an area containing many occupants, but not 3 separate individuals.<br/>    \u2022 you must directly perceive your target\u2014not just something it\u2019s part of or contained inside.<br/>    \u2022 don\u2019t get in a rut\u2014try not to repeat yourself too much in the same scene.<br/><p>Your effect ends if you no longer perceive your target, dawn breaks, or you \u231eweave magic\u231d again. When your effect ends, the logical changes, outcomes, and consequences caused by the effect do not reverse themselves. That building is still on fire, even if the spark is long faded.<br/><p>Decide which Threads the effect depends on. If you\u2019re unsure, ask the GM. You should rationalize creatively, but respect fiction and use common sense. Include every Thread that relates to the effect you\u2019ve described, even if you haven\u2019t bought that Thread. Try to stick to the part of the effect primarily in defiance of reality: you might weave to conjure fire, but it\u2019s normal for fire to burn stuff.<br/><p>From all the Threads your effect depends on, the one with the lowest rating is the weak thread for this effect. If there are multiple with the same low rating, it doesn\u2019t matter; pick one. If no Thread seems to fit, your weak thread is \u22121.<br/><p>If you\u2019re gonna \u231efuck \u2018em up\u231d, you can do at most \u230aweak thread + 1\u230b harm\u2014this means 0 harm if your weak thread is \u22121. If you can\u2019t do enough harm to fit the injuries your description would cause, you\u2019ll need to describe a less devastating effect.<br/><p>When you weave magic to \u231emake a story move\u231d, \u229eweak thread for the story move.</span>"], "status": ""}
