When your effect ends, the logical changes, outcomes, and consequences caused by the effect do not reverse themselves. That building is still on fire, even if the spark is long faded.</m-p>\n\n<m-p>Decide which Threads the effect depends on. If you\u2019re unsure, ask the GM. You should rationalize creatively, but respect fiction and use common sense. Include every Thread that relates to the effect you\u2019ve described, even if you haven\u2019t bought that Thread. Try to stick to the part of the effect primarily in defiance of reality: you might weave to conjure fire, but it\u2019s normal for fire to burn stuff.</m-p>\n\n<m-p>From all the Threads your effect depends on, the one with the lowest rating is the <m-m>\u230aweak thread\u230b</m-m> for this effect. If there are multiple with the same low rating, it doesn\u2019t matter; pick one. If no Thread seems to fit, your <m-m>\u230aweak thread\u230b</m-m> is <m-m>\u230a\u22121\u230b</m-m>.</m-p>\n\n<m-p>If you\u2019re gonna \u231efuck \u2018em up\u231d, you can do at most <m-m>\u230aweak thread + 1\u230b</m-m> harm\u2014this means 0 harm if your weak thread is \u22121.
