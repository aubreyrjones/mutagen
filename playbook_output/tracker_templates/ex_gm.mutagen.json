{"items": ["\ufeffAudience \u25ba This playbook is for GMs of a game using the Mutagen Engine. There\u2019re no secrets, so players are welcome; but the GM\u2019s experience is not the same as the player\u2019s, and this playbook doesn\u2019t mince words about it.\n\n", "Prereqs \u25ba Read the Mutagen Meta section at the back of this playbook. Everything builds from that. Also read a PC playbook so you have an idea what that\u2019s like.\n\n", "Fiction first \u25ba Everything in this game flows from the fiction, not the other way around. Play by figuring out what would logically happen in the \u201creal\u201d world, then figuring out which game mechanic might apply. \n\nA good example is harm: injuries create harm, not the other way around. One of the NPCs shot somebody in the chest: we all know that\u2019s a life-threatening wound, so they take that\u2019s 2 harm. If you got shot with the exact same gun in the hand? 1 harm. In the face? 3 harm. The gun doesn\u2019t do some fixed amount of damage, see? It\u2019s based on what y\u2019all said happened in the story.\n\n", "Love the PCs \u25ba You\u2019ve gotta love the PCs. You\u2019ve gotta be their biggest fan in the whole world. You\u2019ve gotta be curious about them. This is a matter of attitude, and it\u2019s your responsibility; this isn\u2019t about your players making cool enough characters.\n\n", "We\u2019re mediators and facilitators, not auteurs \u25ba If you want to have an epic quest line plotted on a 3-act structure with predetermined encounters and maybe branching results, you\u2019re better at plot than I am, and I encourage you to write a book.\n\nOur role as a GM in this game isn\u2019t to carry the PCs through a plot. Our job is to provide problems to solve, NPCs and scenery, suspense, and consequences. Otherwise the PCs should be writing as much of the story as you can get them to. The more of the story you\u2019ve got them writing, the more epic your contributions feel when you do come in with something you\u2019ve been working on.\n\n", "Plan to improv \u25ba Instead of spending your prep time plotting out intricate storylines and nuanced recurring villains that your players often ignore, just write down cool ideas you have in a notebook. One of these could be an NPC concept, a neat item, an idea for an adventure hook, or a location. Just put down a few key details that distinguishes this corner bar from that corner bar, and move on to the next idea.\n\nThen when your players decide to go off to wherever on their own agendas, you can deftly slip in these fragmentary ideas like you\u2019ve got a whole world meticulously prepared. They won\u2019t even notice you\u2019ve only got 8 words written down about Tobias Trim because you\u2019ve got them doing all the storytelling and inventing fiction anyway, right?\n\n", "Just give them the problem \u25ba Don\u2019t bother trying to balance story problems so that they\u2019re \u201csolvable\u201d. First off, not everybody can fix every problem. But more importantly, PCs in this typically game have larger than life powers in-world, and players have ridiculous amounts of narrative control. They typically can find a solution to most problems\u2014often awesome and shocking solutions you\u2019d never predict.\n\nFailure\u2019s also always an option. Since you don\u2019t have any plot planned, you don\u2019t need the PCs to overcome that challenge just to keep the plot on track. You can always just let them take the loss and try something else.\n\n", "Name (almost) everybody and everything \u25ba Go online and get a name generator and just make a huge list of names. Print it out, bring it to the table, and whenever the PCs interact with an individual NPC, give that NPC a name from the list. You don\u2019t have to be dogmatic about this\u2014sometimes the bouncer\u2019s just \u201cthe bouncer\u201d\u2014but I find it adds a lot for nearly everybody to have a name.\n\nOh, and just tell the players. Part of the point is to make the players see the NPCs as people, which doesn\u2019t work if you hide the name. If an NPC\u2019s identity is secret, give them an alias.\n\n", "The symbols are different here \u25ba In the rest of the playbooks, the symbols \u25b3, \u25cb, and \u25cf have one meaning. In this playbook they have another.\n\n", "Free Moves \u25ba Make moves with a \u25cf whenever you think it\u2019d be cool, or whenever another move suggests it.\n\n\n", "Co-Moves \u25ba Moves with a \u25cb or \u25bb are called co-moves. They have the same name as a move in a PC\u2019s or meta playbook. When a player makes a move, play the appropriate co-move (if there is one).\n\n", "Game Options \u25ba Moves with \u25b3 are optional moves. You should decide before you start playing a new campaign whether or not you want to use the move, as these typically have big impacts on the story. If you decide you\u2019re going to use one of the optional moves, fill the \u25b3 so that you remember your choice and stay consistent.\n\nMoves \u25bb Moves are literally the only things you can do in this game. \u231eAptitudes\u231d and \u231eresources\u231d describe the character, but moves are what let PCs do stuff in the present.\n\nAside from story moves, the rest of the moves a PC has deal with basically \u201cexceptions to the rule\u201d. Normal people don\u2019t throw fireballs, but wizards do and get a move to let them defy the norm. If throwing fireballs is super common in your world, then it wouldn\u2019t need a move.\n\nAptitudes \u25bb Aptitudes basically let us say what a character is good at. Without aptitudes, every PC would have the same chance of succeeding at anything; and any PC would have the same chance of succeeding at everything. Separating aptitudes from moves lets us link them in interesting ways, letting players do the same things via different methods.\n\nResources \u25bb On a technical level, everything the PCs or you \u201chave\u201d, including stuff like \u231estatus\u231d, is a resource. But also resources are probably the easiest base concept to grasp: they\u2019re notes, or points, or some combination of notes and points. They start full, and stay that way, until a move says otherwise.\n\nRespect our limits \u25bb I highly suggest finding a gaming consent form and having your players fill it out before the first session. This is a non-confrontational way to find out what somebody really might have a problem with. Then when you\u2019re building your world and scenarios, you can avoid things that will upset folks.\n\nState a limit \u25bb This means you too! Just say, \u201cJill, I know that might be how she acts, but I\u2019m not comfortable with playing out your character doing that. Could we skip it?\u201d\n\nInvent fiction \u25bb Let them invent fiction, damnit! If they\u2019re not contradicting something established or that you\u2019re holding in surprise, just enjoy the ride.\n\nPush them to engage by leaving blanks in your world. For instance, write down a dark ritual with blanks for the horrible implements, and ask the players what each tool is as the sinister priest pulls it from his robe. A few scenes like this, and they\u2019ll be volunteering stuff.\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the meta \u25bb To a large degree, this goes for you too. Don\u2019t whisper in players\u2019 ears and pass notes. Don\u2019t hide names of people or places (unless the literal name itself ruins a surprise; in which case, maybe rename it).\n\nIf you\u2019re playing some kind of fish-out-of-water game, don\u2019t go describing a cellphone as a \u201cblack crystalline slab with several raised protrusions on one edge\u201d. Nobody will picture what you have in your head, so it won\u2019t be a cool puzzle\u2026 it\u2019s just fucking confusing. Say what it is, and let the PCs roleplay not knowing what it is.\n\nDispute fiction \u25bb This is complicated and ultimately emotional. In other games, it comes up when PCs die\u2014so Mutagen eliminates that issue\u2014but it can still come up if you kill off a favorite NPC in an unsatisfying way. It\u2019s also liable to come up if you just arbitrary erase progress toward PC goals\u2014and for good reason.\n\nBought and free items \u25bb Be careful approving PCs to buy \u25b3, as they\u2019re typically game-altering if the world\u2019s not designed to incorporate them directly. The only \u25b3s in Common are for superhuman levels of Health, but some PC playbooks include them.\n\n\ud83d\udde3Consult the GM \u25bb Stuff with \ud83d\udde3 tends to be not so much game-altering as stuff that will mean something very different in different games. A player might take Spooky Shit assuming it\u2019ll let them talk to ghosts; but there are no ghosts in your world, and you think Spooky Shit is about government conspiracies. So the icon gets y\u2019all talking.\n\n(Progress) Bars \u25bb A progress bar is super simple. You can make them prettier, but here\u2019s an ugly example:\nYou defuse the bomb: \u25a2\u25a2\u25a2\u25a2\nIt\u2019s a thing that\u2019s gonna happen, and it\u2019s a number of ticks for it to happen. Use more ticks to represent more complicated or time-consuming tasks.\n\nUse bars to represent rising tension or progress. They can also be used to represent long-term tasks and projects.\n\nThe point of a bar is to show rising tension to the players. There\u2019s no point in making one if you\u2019re going to keep it hidden.\n\nTick a bar \u25bb Don\u2019t tick bars just based on time passage.\n\nLose what you spend \u25bb The critical part here is that you spend your resource, roll, then find out what happens. This is critical because if you \ud83e\udc55 on special moves, you often restore the resource you just spent.\n\nStatus \u25bb These sometimes trip people up, especially if they\u2019re used to computer RPGs. In this game, a status is literally anything appropriate\u2014there\u2019s no list of statuses. Moves might set or refer to some specific status, but for the most part it\u2019s anything that\u2019s true of something that might change at some point.\n\nEx. broken arm; exhausted; hungry; bleeding out; vulnerable to mistletoe; looking fly; limping; recognized by the Duke; on fire.\n\nNo need to be dogmatic about writing stuff if it\u2019s going to be short-lived. Nobody\u2019s \u201con fire\u201d for long.\n\nRead the dice \u25bb The critical part here is that dice results aren\u2019t in terms of success or failure, but in terms of \u231enarrative momentum\u231d.\n\nNarrative momentum \u2013 This concept represents the ease and control with which the PCs are moving through the story. It\u2019s put in these terms so that we keep the fiction first and focus on interesting evolution of the plot.\n\nImagine a locked door; the only reasonable entrance. The rest of your interesting story is inside.\n\nIf dice rolls decide literal success and failure at a task, it\u2019s easily possible that your thief fails to pick the lock; your brute fails to smash the door. How does your story evolve from here? Abandon it? Deus ex machina? Re-rolls? Defy your story\u2019s logic and say there\u2019s an even less fortified entrance? And what does it say about the PCs that they couldn\u2019t competently thieve or brutalize?\n\nIn this game, instead of dice deciding whether you succeed or fail at a task, they decide whether you get what you want in the immediate and how your attempt affects your ability to get what you want in the near future.\n\nThe default state of most characters in most stories is \ud83e\udc52 (carrying momentum). They\u2019re moving forward according to their plan, dealing with the challenges that they\u2019ve prepared for\u2014they have the initiative. An action hero is kicking ass, but each ass-kicking is its own small challenge. A lawyer is handling a tough witness, but the opposition still has a case.\n\nLow points for characters come when they \ud83e\udc53 (stall momentum). Their plans unravel somehow, and they\u2019re forced to regroup and react\u2014they\u2019ve lost the initiative. The action hero is flanked and surrounded. Opposing counsel brings out some slam-dunk evidence.\n\nNote that in the \ud83e\udc53 examples, our PCs didn\u2019t do anything wrong. They didn\u2019t go from kicking ass and lawyering to floundering incompetently; they\u2019ve just run into a new, bigger problem that demands they regroup and try a new strategy.\n\nWhich also isn\u2019t to say that \ud83e\udc53 never implies failure. If it makes sense and is interesting for the PC to fail at their task, that might be part of \ud83e\udc53. But their failure should come with some kind of new and interesting narrative problem so that the story can keep moving forward. They should never just be in a position to \u201ctry again\u201d.\n\nSometimes a character faces a challenge that they overcome, but which costs them something in the process or makes it harder for them to stick to their plan. In game terms, we say they \ud83e\udc56 (lose momentum). The action hero takes a wound, forcing him to fight off-handed. The lawyer humiliates opposition to win a point, making an enemy.\n\nOn rare occasions, a character gets what they want plus they find themselves in a position to more easily get what they want next. They \ud83e\udc55 (gain momentum). The action hero appropriates a machine gun from his last foe. The judge sustains the lawyer\u2019s objection, and also realizes there\u2019s been a procedural error in her favor.\n\nWhen we roll in this game, especially for a story move, we\u2019re not asking chance to decide whether or not the PC can do what they\u2019re good at. We\u2019re asking whether being good is enough to get them what they want, and where they stand with regards to their next problem.\n\nLow/Zero Effect \u25bb Sometimes a PC\u2019s plan to achieve something just wouldn\u2019t work. Not in the sense that they\u2019ll fail to complete the plan, but in the sense that completing the plan won\u2019t achieve anything. You should limit effect sparingly, only to keep player actions in line with the story world\u2019s logic.\n\nThis is also your main tool to keep players honest about what abilities they\u2019re trying to roll with. Low Effect might strain credulity, while Zero breaks it.\n\nUse Low Effect when the PC will get less of what they want if they succeed. He\u2019s armored, but it\u2019s cloth\u2014less harm. You\u2019re a fast driver, but you\u2019re in a jalopy\u2014closer race. You want to \u229eFighting to cook for a troop of people in a war zone\u2014yeah, I can kinda see that.\n\nUse Zero Effect when the PC will get none of what they want. It\u2019s full plate\u2014no harm. You\u2019re fast, but the car\u2019s on fire\u2014you\u2019re walking. You want to \u229eFighting to re-plant an orchid\u2014how\u2019s that work?\n\nStory moves \u25bb These moves are the core of this whole game. They PCs push a story forward while maintaining risk and surprise. You could tell a complete RPG without anything but the story moves, although characters would feel bland and undifferentiated.\n\nStory moves deal with universal goals that RPG PCs might have from moment to moment in a story. They cover the vast majority of risky, exciting shit that happens in a game. But they don\u2019t care how they do the thing.\n\nFor instance, everybody can try to break an important object (\u231ego apeshit\u231d) to move the story forward. For the sake of figuring out what would be cool if they \ud83e\udc56 while doing it, it doesn\u2019t matter if they used karate or a blowtorch.\n\nMake a story move \u25bb You\u2019ll often need to help players figure out which story move they\u2019re actually making. Ask what they hope to achieve with their actions and pick the move that goes with their narrative goals, don\u2019t focus on how they\u2019re trying to get it or what aptitudes they\u2019re trying to use.\n\nOnce you have their actual goals and therefore the move figured out, they can decide based on their described action if they\u2019ve got an aptitude that\u2019s helping them. Be lenient, but keep players honest about whether their aptitude is really at the core of their action.\n\nThe individual story co-moves have a lot more concrete information and examples.\n"], "status": ""}
