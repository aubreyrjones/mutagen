||                       continue an unlabeled write-in field (if you want it taller than 2 lines in print)

//your text//            italics. Use this only to call out active moves.
!!your text!!            bold. Use this only for things related to rolls.

\your text               text on this line should be included in the previous paragraph
|your text               the paragraph on this line should be minimally-separated from the previous one
