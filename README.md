Mutagen Tabletop RPG Engine
---------------------------

This is the Mutagen Game Engine. It defines basic rules for an
open-source, fiction-first tabletop roleplaying game. It has several
features I consider unique or outstanding:

* Mutagen puts fiction first. Everything in the game is designed to
  help your table tell an exciting and surprising story together.

* Mutagen uses dice. Random chance helps us tell exciting stories at
  the table. And rolling dice is fun.

* Mutagen loves improv. You can plan as intricate a world as you like,
  but Mutagen doesn't require GMs to meticulously design and balance
  encounters before challenging their table. Find out what happens
  along with your players.

* There's no separate rulebook or character sheet. A "playbook" serves
  as both, providing all the rules and recordkeeping that the person
  using it needs. Each player and the GM gets a playbook with exactly
  what's relevant to their role, and each game has custom playbooks
  containing just what's necessary.

* Playbooks are short and self-contained. For most games, PC playbooks
  are 5 pages (6 max!). The GM playbook might be twice as long. Other
  than lore, nobody needs to read anything else to play.

* Mutagen is deep. Because it's fiction first, Mutagen doesn't fill
  pages with rules just to have cool stuff. It just fills pages with
  cool stuff. Different playbooks permit wildly varied playstyles
  within the same game, and wide choice in moves and their application
  gives everybody options.

* Mutagen is for campaigns. I've written it tersely as possible so
  that everybody at the table will read the rules; but it's designed
  to support full-length, full-engagement campaigns.

* Mutagen is for one-shots. Most people can read the rules in about 10
  minutes if they aren't interrupted, and explore the rest of their
  playbooks in another 10 minutes. So long as the game's premise is
  simple enough, many GMs can get a group playing in half an hour.

* Mutagen loves homebrew. You can tell a gripping story of human
  struggle in any genre with just the Meta and Common playbooks, then
  layer in exactly the uncanny powers and abilities you imagine to
  make your story superhuman.

* There's meta-meta support. :) There's a Designer playbook which
  might help you get into the Mutagen headspace when writing a game or
  homebrew using the system. There's also a simple automation
  framework for piecing together multiple playbooks into seamless
  final documents for your players.

* It's open source, even for commercial use. The core Mutagen system
  and several example playbooks are available for your own use,
  without asking permission, even for commercial purposes--with
  certain restrictions. You can protect your lore, world, art, merch
  and stuff under regular trade law. See "Copyright and License" below
  for more.


Building Playbooks
------------------

You can manually build full playbooks using OpenOffice, but if you're
doing it a lot, it's potentially easier to use the included Makefile.

Okay, stay with me for a minute. I've been hacking away at this engine
for, like, a lot of hours now. I've got all the common rules of the
game cut down to 4 pages. Even if you knew you'd license an engine,
did you expect to get it down to 4 pages?

What's more, you don't even have to print those pages in your
book. You're gonna publish them in PDFs just like you'd planned for
your character sheets. Character sheets you're not gonna have to
design anymore--although of course you can tart them up if you've got
the budget. You also get free modular document generation if you can
find (or are) the right kind of nerd to run GNU `make`.

Unless you want to, you don't have to publish any mechanical rules in
your book. You can fill every page with the awesome fruits of your
imagination without wasting anything on how tables decide the next
narrative beat. Or you can cut your page count and widen your margin.

If you don't screw it up, you're going to write 1 page (2 max!) for
the playbook representing each class or whatever in your game. And
since there's literally no space for lore or worldbuilding in those
measley columns, they're gonna be almost 100% game mechanics--nigh
uncopyrightable anyway.

Finally you've got to remember: this is a fiction first game, so the
'game mechanics' just call right back into the fiction anyway. That'd
be the book you're selling. [Or actually it could be a movie, a novel,
Patreon serial, or any other media you're making. I'd love to see some
author publish playbooks to go with their novel.]

So check it out: in your book, which you're publishing for cash moneys
and want trad copyright on, you describe this dope-ass creature you're
calling a Mana Guppy. You tell your readers all about the crazy shit
it can do, how it looks, what it expects from its chosen Guppy
Tender. That's all in your book with trad copyright. Within the law,
ain't nobody can yoink your Mana Guppy.

Then in a completely separate PDF you were gonna give away anyway,
you'll put a line in the Guppy Tender playbook that's like `â—‹ Summon
Mana Guppy - Spend 1 Guppy Bait. If the conditions are right, you
summon your Mana Guppy.` And you're telling me--the guy giving you a
game engine you don't even have to print--you can't even share *that
much*?
